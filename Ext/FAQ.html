<tr><td><font size="4"><div id="working">
<b>Q:</b>How does this extension work and which type of pages should I annotate?
<br><b>A:</b> It's a very simple annotating tool and since annotation happen only at your computer it is quite fast. Also strictly speaking any page could be annotated, however, it is good to know it's working, which would help one to decide (more effectively) where to use it.<br>
<b>Working:</b> Essentially, any annotations done to web pages, simply modify the <i>html</i> and save it locally (in extension storage). Later, whenever browser request the same <i>url</i> again, if a local copy is present then actual page is replaced by the local copy (which has annotations).<br>
<b>So, which pages should I annotate:</b> It is best to use it for pages which are static, where for a given <i>url</i>, content does not change. Thus it should be avoided for pages which shows search results or have links to several articles which keeps changing like pages showing news. This also means that, if extension is re-installed, then all the annotations will be lost. Future updates will likely address this issue, however no ETA could be given as of now.

<tr><td><font size="4"><div id="deletedExtension">
<b>Q:</b> I reinstalled extension, and all my contents are lost. How can I get it back?
<br><b>A:</b> Unfortunately, uninstalling the extension will also delete all the annotations. This is due to simplicity of the extension (please see the <a href='#working'>working of extension</a>). We understand, this is a major limitation, and we are working on resolving it.

<b>Q:</b> I disabled the extension for a page, still it is causing my web page to be messed up.
<br><b>A:</b> This should not happen. Kindly confirm it by disabling the extension and ensuring that it is in fact being done by this extension. If this is indeed the case, it is due to a bug which we have not expected so far. If possible kindly send us the <i>url</i> of the page (at neuralnetworks2.0@gmail.com) for which it is happening. If the page is behind a login, kindly save the page (using <i>save as</i> or <i>Ctrl + s</i>), with and without (after disabling) extension and send that too.
