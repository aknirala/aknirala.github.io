<h3>PhD Stuff (at ISU): Aug 2017 - current</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Thesis Research (under <a href='https://faculty.sites.iastate.edu/jtian/'>Prof Jin Tian</a>.)</b>: <i>Robustness and interpretability of deep learning systems:</i>  During my search for a suitable research area, I took the time to explore different fields such as causality, missing data, RCN, deepfakes, and GANs. I finally found my niche in the area of adversarial robustness and interpretability in machine learning by the Spring of 2021. I learned that adversarial attacks can significantly impact any machine learning system, yet despite extensive research in this field, there is still a long way for it to be as good as biological perception. I argue that without an error correction mechanism, like what biological perception relies on, the task would remain challenging.</li>


<h4>Other work during PHD</h4>
<li><b>RA work: CyAds(2019-2020):</b> Under <a href='https://www.cs.iastate.edu/people/adisak-sukul'>Dr Adisak Sukul</a> (<i>NSF funded</i>). Project goal: To assess user targeting in digital politcal advertisement. Analysis indicated ad spending targeted only at state level. It has four major steps:
<ol><li>Collecting YouTube ads from different US states with different age and sex profiles. Created a chrome-extension and a Django server (to bypass not a robot check).</li>
<li>Classifying the political and nonpolitical ads.</li>
<li>Applying NLP and computer vision to extract several details such as content and category (attack vs promotion vs contrast) [Ref: <a href='https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7823579'>Lei Qi.</a>].</li>
<li>Analyzing the data to estimate the amount of spending, to clarify the user profiling, and so on.</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li><b>TA work: </b> I have TA-ed several courses: COMS 227: ; COMS 228; ;DS 201; COMS 311, and c and I am currently TA-ing COMS 472/572. 
<ul><li>
During this time, I also had the opportunity to deliver several lectures for the AI course, covering topics such as <a href='https://iastate.webex.com/webappng/sites/iastate/recording/607f892c5187103bbf7c00505681f3e1/playback'>Intro to ML</a>, <a href='https://iastate.webex.com/webappng/sites/iastate/recording/0ef3198d531a103bb17700505681f78a/playback'>Linear Regression</a>, and <a href='https://iastate.webex.com/webappng/sites/iastate/recording/47decc8b54ac103bbfbf0050568152f3/playback'>Neural Networks</a>. 
</li></ul>
</li>

<li>Work before finalizing my PhD topic
<ul>
<li>RCN (last worked on JAN 2021): I came across RCN during my research into the work of Jeff Hawkins, author of "<a href='https://www.amazon.com/Intelligence-Understanding-Creation-Intelligent-Machines/dp/0805078533'>On Intelligence</a>". Initially, RCN appeared to be very promising as it achieved high robust accuracy on the MNIST dataset (<a href='https://github.com/vicariousinc/science_rcn'>as it is</a>). However, after further investigation, I came to the conclusion that neural networks are likely a generalization of RCN. This realization is documented in a <a href='https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YRI52-PCplAha5BO74MoIsrotV0RvQAuYTfiSUGy8Ts/edit?usp=sharing'>presentation</a> I created (Please note that the presentation reflects my preliminary research findings and is not polished or finalized as the results were inconclusive).</li>
<li>GAN</li>
<li>Bayesian Network (last worked on JAN 2021), learning structure using partition search: <a href='https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wZJlrkq1Y5ILvd_icMYFIzxS9jW2Roef9HIdCkWYcgc/edit?usp=sharing'>Presentation</a> on why order search is already better.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>I shall add more details for Bayesian Networks, GANs, and few other projects in a day or two.</li>

<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Qdon3JR6TE&feature=youtu.be&t=180'>My first skydiving</a>. Sky Diving, is so under rated. The rush of adrenaline was indescribable - it felt like I was floating on air. The peace and serenity at the top of the world was unmatched. I was envious of birds as they have the ability to fly freely, while I was limited to the direction of my parachute. Although we have airplanes and jet engines, nothing compares to the freedom of flight. If only humans weren't so heavy, perhaps someday we'll have iron man suits that allow us to fly just like birds.

<li><b>Seeing the matrix: as it is</b>

<td>
A brief thought experiment reveals that the world is not what it appears to be. The second law of thermodynamics and the increasing entropy of the universe suggest that time had a beginning and that the universe has a finite age. The concept of physical reality being split into smaller parts raises questions about its true physical nature. The reality of quantum computing, where a single qubit can exist in multiple states at the same time, further complicates our understanding of the world.. or multiverse. <br><br>

People often neglect to contemplate the underlying nature of reality. It seems a bit odd to me, how can one not get bothered by this. In my search for answers, I explored religious practices but ultimately concluded they were simply a form of commerce. ipassana meditation offers a promising approach, and I am actively practicing it in hopes of one day "seeing the matrix." <br><br>

Understanding physics is another way of doing it. Thanks to coursera, just for curiosity, sometimes I dive into courses like <a href='Relativity/index.html'>relativity, quantum computing</a>.

<br>This was an amazing book. I always wondered, why rereading a paper many times in one seating didn't give me the kind of insights which I get when I read it after some time (days/weeks). As per book, during NREM sleep, day to day memories from hippocampus, are transferred to neocortex (permanent storage). This process is quite active and I believe some form of indexing ect also happens. Thus next time when we read the same thing we are making new connections which is often not possible, no matter how hard we try in the first go. Cracking this code completely would be awesome.</td></tr>
