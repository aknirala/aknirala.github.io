<h3>Current trivia</h3>
<ul>
<li>Going through CS20SI, to understand tensorflow better. Would do a writeup soon.</li>
<li>Brushing up ML, Probability and Linear Algebra. Idea is:
<ul>
<li>Hone my ML skills, and also a bit of probability and maths needed for it.</li>
<li>I would try to code (search esxisting code) improtant stuff (like application of certain algo) and would keep uploading it here.</li>
<li>Know most of the concepts covered in the Bishop book and understand many (this one is a long project, will taake few months).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Working on BRAIN: It is an organizer and note-taking application. It stores the information at a very granular level, in directed acyclic graph, and acts like a secondary storage unit for us. It has a little intelligence as well (thus the name BRAIN), and it is still work in progress. Till the time it comes out (easily +6 months), please use my <a href='https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/annotate-web-pages/emajnoacacifjgmkkmheackniabamonm'>annotation chrome extension</a>. :-)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Done/Maintaining</h3>
<ul>
<li>2017 04 29 (ongoing) Some maths, and ML concepts:
<ul>
<li><a href='MathAndML/ShortMathsStuff.html'>Some basic maths concepts</a>. More to be added in time.</li>
<li><a href='MathAndML/GaussianDistrib.html'>Gaussian distribution.</a></li>
<li><a href='MathAndML/ExponentialFamily.html'>Exponential Family distribution.</a></li>
<li><a href='MathAndML/nonParamMethods.html'>Some non-parametric methods</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2017 04 24: Published my first chrome extension: <a href='https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/annotate-web-pages/emajnoacacifjgmkkmheackniabamonm'>Annotate Web pages</a>
<ul>
<li>This is the first version, I would be updating it to include many more features to it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2017 03 23: Completed the <a href='https://www.coursera.org/learn/einstein-relativity/home/info'>Understanding Einstein: The Special Theory of Relativity</a> course from Coursera
<ul><li>A write-up on this is <a href='Relativity/index.html'>here</a></li></ul>
</li>
<li>2017 03 21: Completed CS 224D. Assignment solutions here. <a href='https://github.com/aknirala/CS224D/'>https://github.com/aknirala/CS224D/</a>
<ul>
<li>NN Forward and backward equation derivation <a href='CS224D/FowdBkws.html'>here</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Nice (Different, substantive)</h3>
<ul>
<li>2017 04 29: Didn't knew that even, non-relegious people are so much brain-washed. <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ed4SeoQypy0'>Why I escaped from my brainwashed country | Hyeonseo Lee | TEDxKyoto</a>. What is the solution? Which policy should we make? What to do?</li>
<li>2017 03 21: This TED talk is amazing: <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OLFwkfPxCg'>The weirdness of water could be the answer | Marcia Barbosa | TEDxCER</a>. Just watch it at 1.5x. The enthusiasm with which she explains things, and of course the fluency comes from absolute control/knowledge of her research, simply made my day.<li>
</ul>
