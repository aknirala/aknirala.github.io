<h3>PhD Stuff (at ISU): Aug 2017 - current</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Thesis Research</b>: I am pursuing my PhD under <a href='http://web.cs.iastate.edu/~jtian/'>Prof Jin Tian</a>. My research revolves around learning Bayesian Networks from data. My thesis would be (as per current plan) to learn m-graph [Ref: <a href='https://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r410.pdf'>K Mohan 2013</a>] from missing data: i.e., given a data containing missing values, devise techniques to learn Bayesian Networks where variables causing missingness are also present.<br>

Currently however I am trying to tackle a bit simpler problem, with no missing data, wherein I am working with different search spaces to learn Bayesian Network more efficiently. Specifically I am exploring if search in partition space [Ref: <a href='https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01621459.2015.1133426?journalCode=uasa20'>J. Kuipers and G. Moffa</a>], could give better/faster results as compared to ordered space [Ref: <a href='https://ai.stanford.edu/~koller/Papers/Teyssier+Koller:UAI05.pdf'>Mare and D Koller 2005</a>; <a href='https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5803-learning-bayesian-networks-with-thousands-of-variables'>Muro 2015</a>]. Specifically, I am trying to adapt code present <a href='https://github.com/mauro-idsia/blip/blob/master/core/src/main/java/ch/idsia/blip/core/learn/solver/src/asobs/AsobsSearcher.java'>here</a>, by mauro-idsia.</li>
<li><b>Research Assistant work</b>: Working with <a href='https://www.cs.iastate.edu/people/adisak-sukul'>Dr Adisak Sukul</a> on NSF funded project. Project involves: automated collection and coding of online campaign advertising. It has four major steps:
<ol><li>Collecting YouTube ads from different US states with different age and sex profiles (currently on this step).</li>
<li>Classifying the political and nonpolitical ads.</li>
<li>Applying NLP and computer vision to extract several details such as content and category (attack vs promotion vs contrast) [Ref: <a href='https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7823579'>Lei Qi.</a>].</li>
<li>Analyzing the data to estimate the amount of spending, to clarify the user profiling, and so on.</li>
</ol>

Involved a course project: For the project, I tried to do speech recognition using <a href='https://cmusphinx.github.io/'>Shpinx</a>. I downloaded video from CNBC TV 18, an Indian business and stock news channel. Extracted audio from it. Did transcription for few minutes and then tried to do it via Sphinx. I found that while distinguishing advertisement from news was fairly simple, speech recognition was dependent on speaker acoustic model, and was not good for all but one anchor. Creating individual speaker acoustic model was out of scope for the project.

<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Qdon3JR6TE&feature=youtu.be&t=180'>My first skydiving</a>. Sky Diving, is so under rated. The experience was so exhilarating that words can't do justice to it. It felt as if I am floating. It was also so peaceful and calm, literally top of the world  experience. I could glide/fly in any direction I wanted.<br>
This have, forever made me jealous of birds, who actually have wings and can fly. Sure we have airplanes and jet engines, but having ones own wings and flying ... well everything fades in front of that. Too bad we humans are so heavy... perhaps one day Elon Musk or someone will develop iron man suits.

<li><b>Seeing the matrix: as it is</b>
<table>
<tr>

<td>
A bit of thought experiment would reveal that world is clearly not what it looks like. For example:
<ul><li> Second law of thermodynamics and expanding entropy of universe suggests that: The Universe has a beginning and time started sometime....</li>
<li>Since in theory we can always split things, thus, physical reality can not be physical..</li>
<li>Quantum computing is a reality, so a single qubit is in different state at the same time???</li>
</ul>
And yet, people don't bother to think about it and are busy living (whatever that means) and butchering innocent animals. I tried getting answers from religious practices but realized it is just another business (nothing more, IMHO). Vipassana meditation, in theory looks sound but who knows... Anyways I am actively practicing it and hope someday I'll be able to see the matrix.<br><br>
Understanding physics is another way of doing it, (and I also do it (thanks to Coursera)), but my chances of contributing to that (or even understanding it completely) is slim to none. I do enjoy reading about relativity and quantum computing.

<br>This was an amazing book. I always wondered, why rereading a paper many times in one seating didn't give me the kind of insights which I get when I read it after some time (days/weeks). As per book, during NREM sleep, day to day memories from hippocampus, are transferred to neocortex (permanent storage). This process is quite active and I believe some form of indexing ect also happens. Thus next time when we read the same thing we are making new connections which is often not possible, no matter how hard we try in the first go. Cracking this code completely would be awesome.</td></tr>
