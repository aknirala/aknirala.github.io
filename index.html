<ul><li>
In June 2017, <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-question-pairs'>Quora Question Pairs</a> (task of identifying question pairs, that have the same intent, as asked on Quora) was hosted on Kaggle. (I was only able to get to top 14%). None of the Kernels submitted were doing actual parsing (which seems a bit surprising).</li>
<li>
<a href='https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-question-pairs/discussion/34166'>My core idea</a> is to dependency parse the sentence and use lexical resources (WordNet, ConceptNet etc), to compare the semantic similarity between different words. I would also need to come up with a way to score the similarity between two graphs.</li>

<li><b>Working on BRAIN (not so actively):</b>

Idea is:
<ul>
<li>It is an organizer, a note-taking application and perhaps a secondary storage unit (primary being our head).</li>
<li>It stores the information at a very granular level, with concepts connected to each other (like a graph of concept), and acts like.</li>
<li>It has a little intelligence as well (thus the name BRAIN), and it is still work in progress.</li>
<!--<li>Unlike other note taking applications, it is active (not passive)</li>-->
