<h3>Current trivia</h3>
<ul>
<li>Going through CS20SI, to understand tensorflow better. Would do a writeup soon.</li>
<li>Brushing up ML, Probability and Linear Algebra. Idea is:
<ul>
<li>Hone my ML skills, and also a bit of probability and maths needed for it.</li>
<li>I would try to code (search esxisting code) improtant stuff (like application of certain algo) and would keep uploading it here.</li>
<li>Know most of the concepts covered in the Bishop book and understand many (this one is a long project, will taake few months).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Working on BRAIN: It is an organizer and note-taking application. It stores the information at a very granular level, in directed acyclic graph, and acts like a secondary storage unit for us. It has a little intelligence as well (thus the name BRAIN), and it is still work in progress. Till the time it comes out (easily +6 months), please use my <a href='https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/annotate-web-pages/emajnoacacifjgmkkmheackniabamonm'>annotation chrome extension</a>. :-)</li>
</ul>
