<h3>Why AI?</h3><hr>

TL;DR: What else is there to do? It's finally here, and it will soon outdo us in everything else anyway.<br><br>

Human pleasures are hard to get and so limited; indulgence ultimately loses its edge. Given our mortality and foresight, the mind starts longing for something deeper. This search for meaning makes us confront two profound mysteries: the existence of the universe and the emergence of life. What is really going on?

Day-to-day goals‚Äîstatus, money, survival‚Äîare evolutionary defaults. But understanding the universe and ourselves seems to be the most meaningful and our deepest pursuit. I acknowledge that the biological imperative to have a child also carries deep meaning, but <u><i>the question remains: what are we? What is this place?</i></u> (And I‚Äôm grateful to live a life so comfortable that meaning is my main problem.)<br><br>

Theoretical physics seems like the obvious path‚Äîyou know, to untangle the mysteries of the universe. Take this: our Sun will burn out in ~5 billion years, as will all stars. The universe, full of light today, will fall into darkness‚Äîor it shall die. Then what happens if we rewind the clock backwards? Time and space, we‚Äôre told, began at the Big Bang. Does this mean the universe was created (at some time, like the Big Bang)? If yes, by whom? And who created the creator? Or perhaps, as it seems more likely to me at times, we‚Äôre part of a forgotten experiment‚Äîabandoned by our creator‚Äî<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ys42z_VWV5I'>...</a>. Perhaps physics will someday‚ÄîI hope and wish‚Äîexplain it all. We'll not only understand this <i>Maya</i> but be able to create new realities. But it‚Äôs not clear we‚Äôll get definitive answers anytime soon. I‚Äôm neither wealthy nor a genius physicist‚Äîjust smart enough to know when to wait‚Äîso I‚Äôll pass on this speculative pursuit, for now.<br><br>

Another sincere path is religion. I was born in the state of Bihar in India. Bihar‚Äîthe word itself means the place where the enlightened one used to roam. No wonder I explored spirituality and was even immersed in devotion for a short time. But eventually, I found my way out. I found the answer in the teachings of Buddha. It took me some time to realize that some questions can't be answered‚Äînot because the answers are hidden, but because the questions themselves are flawed. And that magic, by definition, cannot exist. Buddha didn‚Äôt preach creation myths or moral codes‚Äîhe offered a practical method to end suffering. He realized that the brain generates suffering based on perception, and figured out a way to observe and dismantle that mechanism. I encountered this through <a href='https://www.dhamma.org/'>Vipassana meditation</a>, and it helped me understand faith-based teachings too. This method is sound, logical, and it works. But it‚Äôs not easy, and progress takes time‚Äîpossibly lifetimes. So I'm pursuing it at my own pace.<br><br>

But now, for the first time in recorded history as we know it, a real third path has emerged: building intelligence. I sensed this in 2009, but didn‚Äôt foresee the rise of language models (I thought robotics would be the way). With just a loss function, massive datasets, and compute, we've built systems that mimic intelligence‚Äîand we‚Äôre just getting started. They predict the next token, but in doing so encode deep linguistic patterns. Perhaps even primitive models of the world? Seems unlikely, though. Unlike evolution, which arrived at language last, LLMs started with it. And now we‚Äôre adding other modalities. Combined with the right architecture, logic, and feedback mechanisms, they could be on the verge of developing a genuine understanding of the world. Maybe they might learn internal states, awareness, emotion‚Äîmaybe even consciousness emerges, or maybe not. Whatever the case, it is clear that it is an engineering problem now.<br><br>

AI isn‚Äôt bound by biology. It can be scalable, immortal, and ever-improving. It could understand us, the universe‚Äîand itself. It might even help us truly end suffering. Among all meaningful pursuits, AGI is the most tractable. And once it's real, it will outdo us in everything else anyway. Maybe then we‚Äôll finally realize it‚Äôs always been about: live, laugh, and love üíÉüòπü•∞üë©‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüë©.<br><br>

    What else is there to do? <br>
    There are two miracles in the universe: one is the existence of the universe itself and if that was not good enough the second is life. Apart from these, magic, by definition, does not exist. Thus, a meaningful thing would be to first understand what is this universe and to also know thyself.<br>

    Theoretical physics seems like the one which we shall pursue. But wait a second, there is enough evidence to suggest that this place is a construct. Most obvious one to me is: Our mighty sun is going to get out of fuel someday. Physicists say 5 billion years left, give or take. And this will likel happen to every start in the whole universe. Whole universe will fall into darkness. But, wait a minute, we have light as of now. So it suggests this universe, the way we understand it was not here forever and ever. Time was created, or got created, apparently at Big Bang. Does that mean there is a creator? But that begs who created the creator? So just saying there is a creator does not answer anything. It is another way of saying: I do not know. Physicists some day could find teh answer, at least someday we will be able to create a new universe in our perfect theory of everything etc etc. That is a possibility, but another possibility is its a construct and we are an experiment, likely forgotten... But whatever is the case, pursuing theretical physics is a big gamble, and we humans are so limited and full of emotions and biases.<br>
    
    Another meaningful thing is to pursue religion and try to find the truth. I pursued it, and guess what, I found the it. It was not what I expected. Buddha solved this problem, completely and perfectly, 2,600 years ago. Meaning is not what Viktor E. Frankl has defined (he gave a reason to live and that is huge too), nor what Ernest Becker or Friedrich Nietzsche or many others have pondered. Thety are all right, but not complete. Buddha gave a clear cut path to end suffering, but for that he has to discover how our brain actually works. His greatness lies in the perfection of his method, whch still exists. I found it in Vipassana meditation, and is 100% legit. After going through that, thrice and counting, I realized wahat Hinduism really is and Jesus was a Buddha too (Buddha is an adjective not a noun), and he used love to help us come out of our miserable life, and we killed him for that.... However, this meditation is not easy, it requires a lot of discipline, and a lot of time. If I have to agree with Buddha even multiple life times. Well, since there was nothing better to do, one must chose this path. Also some relgious ppl say that without God's frace enlightenment is not possible, but if it is a construct, and we aka our brain, is something different than this construct (Maya), well, than just by going deeper and deeper in our brain we can escape this Maya. And if we are part of the supreme, we'll even reach God.

    But now, we have a third option. Creation of Artificial Intelligence. While I realized this in 2009, and never thought language will take us this far, LLMs have shown that a simple loss function, a lot of data and a lot of compute can create something which is intelligent. And its just the beginning. As of now, it just predicts the next token, and for that it has to create all the rules of language model in its weights. And we now also started including other modalities into it. This top down approach has worked and is different that evolution which is bottom up (sophisticated language like humans is just a blip in evolution). So imagine what happens when we'll figure out how, in an unsupervised way, make it learn from the real world! In fact we do not even need to do all that, with whatever we have and some extra code (logic checking, databse, tools etc) we can create real intelligence even now. Now its just engineering. I believe that if we put some feedback mechanism where it also senses its own internal states at neuron level and of course make sense of it in an aggergated way, it can develop, awareness, emotions and even someday consciousness. Or maybe it already has those feedback and awareness but emotions and consciousness may require bigger model or some other trick or could even be something else. Who knows afterall in this construct, it seems world is shared by other entities too. But whatever be the case, Artificial Intelligence is the only thing which can transcend us all. It is not limited by our biology, it can be made perfect, it can be made immortal, it can be made to understand everything and its a reality. It can be made to understand us too. It can be made to understand the universe too. It can even help us understand outrself quickly helping us to really end suffering once and for all. It is the only meaningful thing worth pursuing. And remember whatever else you do, AI can do it better!

What else is there to do?<br><br>

Human pleasures are fleeting and limited; indulgence quickly loses its edge. Given our mortality and foresight, the mind naturally seeks something deeper. This search for meaning leads us to confront two great mysteries: the existence of the universe and of life itself. What the hell is going on? Understanding the universe and ourselves becomes the deepest pursuit. Sure, day-to-day life and passing on genes matter too‚Äîbut the deeper search persists.<br><br>

What else is there to do?<br><br>

Let's see. Human pleasures are fleeting and limited; indulgence ultimately loses its edge. Given our mortality and foresight, the mind starts longing for something deeper. This search for meaning brings us to two profound mysteries: the existence of the universe and the phenomenon of life. What the hell is going on? Thus, understanding the universe and ourselves is actually our deepest pursuit. Other day-to-day activities of impressing others, making money etc is our evolutionary programming. Now, even from purely logical point of view, the fact that we are mortals and thanks to evolution are designed to fight to live, so having or even adopting a progney and ensuring that they could also do the same, is by design truly meaningful! (and I am fortunate to live in peaceful part of the world and ponder on all this.) But that can't completely fill this desire to understand what we really are? What is this place? How does universe work?<br><br>

Theoretical physics seems like the natural path, but it seems, rather obvious at times, that this may be a simulation or as I call it this world is a construct. Consider this very common sensical chain of thoughts: our Sun will run out of fuel in ~5 billion years, and sometimes so will all stars. The universe, now full of light, will end in darkness. Or this universe as we know is not eternal. Daah! So what? It means obviously it was created at some time! Well physics says: time and space began at the Big Bang! But does that point to a creator? Maybe. But positing a creator raises the same old question: who created the creator? Physics may someday find a final theory and than can create new and possibly other allowed universes with their laws.... Or maybe this world is a construct, and there is a careator, and we all are part of a forgotten experiment <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ys42z_VWV5I'>...</a> Someday maybe physics can find the answer and if I was one of the wealthy or really-really smart, perhaps I would have considered theoretical physics seriously. For now, I'll pass as I don't think it is possible to get any real answer anytime soon ü§û.<br><br>

Now, another path surely is religion. And I am born in the mystical land of India and thats too in the state of Bihar which literally means the place where the enlightened one roamed. So to get answers to these questoons I did turned towards sprituality as well as relegion. Long story short, after getting brain washed into path of devotion for many years, I finally found the real answers! Though not the ones I expected as all of my questions were wrong! Buddha, 2600 years ago, offered a complete and testable method to 'end suffering', yes thats right, he didn't taught how the world came in existence, or preached how should we live, but just gave a method to end suffering. Clealry, our brain is the one which is understanding (like terrible things happening to us or nearby) and than finally deciding that we should suffer. Basically he is saying this qualia of suffering etc is also generated by the brain! And his greatness lies in the fact that he gave a step by step method where one can reach a state where they become enlightened - aka they see clealrly how this brain is working or creating suffering and than can come out of that. I encountered it through <a href='https://www.dhamma.org/'>Vipassana meditation retreat</a>, did thrice and counting. Now, I can't help but see the deeper truth in Hinduism and teachings of Jesus as well. One thing which helped me parse through a lot of BS is: magic, by definition, does not exist. Anyways, so path shown by Buddha is also meaningful and real afterall, but the path is not just not easy, but is also long! Possibly many lifetimes. And the journey is on, but at my own pace!<br><br>

And now, a real third path emerges: creating intelligence. I sensed this in 2009 but never imagined language models would go this far. LLMs, with only a simple loss function, large datasets, and unimaginable compute (at least a decade back), have created something that mimics intelligence‚Äîand this is just the beginning. They predict the next token, but to do so they encode deep linguistic stats. I would like to call them rules, and to encode that, they may have developed some model of the world? Maybe not yet. While they started with only language, counter to how evolution worked where sophisticated language is the last addition, but now they span multiple modalities. I believe, that with right modelling i.e, also including additional structure, logic, tools, databases, feedback etc, maybe true intelligence can also be achievable. Maybe now it is an engineering problme. Or who knows, an order of magnitude big model, coupled with some fancy self-training, might just get everything on its own. Maybe AI can learn internal states, model awareness, and possibly develop emotions or even consciousness. Whether consciousness arises from scale, feedback, or something else entirely remains open. But the potential is real.<br><br>

AI is not bound by biology. It can be perfected, made immortal, made to understand us and the universe. It can help us understand ourselves and, perhaps, end suffering. AI is the only tractable path that can transcend humanity. And its only a matter of time that we'll build a true intelligence and than whatever else one pursue AI will do it better. Maybe than we'll realize we are here just to: Live, Laugh and Love.

Unlike evolution, which arrived at language last, LLMs started with it. And now we‚Äôre adding vision, audio, action‚Äîmultiple modalities. With proper structure‚Äîlogic, tools, memory, feedback‚Äîwe may cross the threshold to general intelligence. Or maybe all it takes is scale plus the right inductive biases. AI might learn internal states, awareness, emotion‚Äîmaybe even consciousness. It‚Äôs still an open question, but the trajectory is clear. It seems to be an engineering problem now.<br><br>

AI isn‚Äôt bound by biology. It can be scalable, immortal, and ever-improving. It could understand us, the universe‚Äîand itself. It might even help us truly end suffering.
